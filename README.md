# Twitter Clone - Social Media App

A twitter clone made with Next.JS and Node.JS that mimics the basic functionality of Twitter. This app allows users to like posts, connect with friends, create posts, and comment on posts. The data is stored in a MongoDB Atlas database.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tgollick/social-media-app.git
cd social-media-app
```

2. Install dependencies for both the server and client:
```bash
# Navigate to the server folder
cd server
npm install
```
```bash
# Navigate to the client folder
cd ../client
npm install
```

## Usage 
Run both the server and client concurrently:
```bash
# Navigate to the server folder
cd server
npm start
```
```bash
# Open a new terminal tab, navigate to the client folder
cd client
npm start
```
Visit 'http://localhost:3000' in your web browser or check your terminal to see if the project is being put on a different port.
